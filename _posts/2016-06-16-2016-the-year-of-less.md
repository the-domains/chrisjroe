# 2016, the year of less.

I've been wanting to address the slogan I've been throwing around on social media as I don't feel I've fully explained what the year of less actually means. To me 2016 is a time to declutter my life and allow myself the funds, focus and free time to devote to my passions. Whether it be writing, photography or mingling with awesome creative people on the Internet. In the spirit of less I have provided a few short examples below of just how I'm working towards this goal, these areas will be explored in a bit more depth in future posts but for now...

Website -- the move from Squarespace to Tumblr may seem backwards to some but for me it allows complete control from a mobile device. This means I no longer need to use a laptop and it also means I'm saving over £12+vat/$12 on subscription fees per month. The freedom to run my blog from anywhere with a cellular connection cannot be overlooked.

Debt -- That dirty word, I'm putting a huge emphasis on reducing my monthly outgoings. That means goodbye Netflix account and hello weekly direct debits into my savings account. Once debt is removed from the equation, my stress levels will be cut in half!

Time -- Time is something we cannot buy, it is also something that we are blind as to how much we have left. This is why I have begun to think more carefully about how and who I spend my time with.
